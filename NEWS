## 2.4 (14. October 2014)
Minor release to provide a feature that I need.

  - New function `mountpoint` gets the mountpoint of a filesystem
    with a particular UUID or exits with a failure. Useful for
    when you don't know where the source filesystem will be
    mounted. You have to use it yourself though.
  - Bugfix: missing `local` in all functions.

## 2.3 (21. July 2012)

  - Prints the current date and time using date function into
    a timestamp file.

## 2.2 (16. April 2012)

  - Bugfix: `compress` function now compresses the archive based on
    file ending; the program `tar` is used now instead of `bsdtar`.

## 2.1 (29. February 2012)

  - Added function `isynch`, which interactively lets you synchronize
    one folder
  - Added `--help` option (only commandline) and text
  - Added adjustable timeout option
  - Added internable `read_timeout` option
  - Replacing all instances of `echo` with `printf`, since we don't
    know what we are printing (could lead to subtle bugs).
  - Added function confirm, which confirms a question, to be used
    with `if`
